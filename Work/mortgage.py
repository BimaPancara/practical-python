# Exercise 1.7

#Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. 
#The interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11. 
#Here is a program that calculates the total amount that Dave will have to pay over the life of the mortgage:

principal = 500000.0
rate = 0.05
payment = 2684.11
total_paid = 0.0
months_needed=0

extra_payment_start_month = 61
extra_payment_end_month = 108
extra_payment = 1000

while principal > 0:
    principal = principal * (1+rate/12) - payment
    total_paid = total_paid + payment
    months_needed+=1

    if months_needed >= extra_payment_start_month and months_needed <= extra_payment_end_month:
        principal=principal-extra_payment
        total_paid=total_paid+extra_payment

    print(months_needed, round(total_paid,2), round(principal,2))
    
print("Total Paid",round(total_paid))
print("Months",months_needed)

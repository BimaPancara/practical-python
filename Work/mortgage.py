# Exercise 1.7

#Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 
#with Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. 
#The interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11. 
#Here is a program that calculates the total amount that 
#Dave will have to pay over the life of the mortgage:

# Set The Condition
principal = 500000.0
rate = 0.05
payment = 2684.11
total_paid = 0.0
months_needed=0

extra_payment_start_month = 61
extra_payment_end_month = 108
extra_payment = 1000

# Loop for counting payment
while principal > 0:
    principal = principal * (1+rate/12) - payment
    total_paid = total_paid + payment
    months_needed+=1

    # Conditional for setting the principal and total paid value
    if months_needed >= extra_payment_start_month and months_needed <= extra_payment_end_month:
        principal=principal-extra_payment
        total_paid=total_paid+extra_payment
    
    # Print explanations
    print(f'{months_needed} Months pass, ${total_paid:0.2f} Paid ${principal:0.2f} left')

# Print the summary
print(f'{total_paid:0.2f}')    
print(f"Total Paid is {total_paid:0.2f}")
print(f"In {months_needed} Months")
print(f'Years Pass {months_needed/12:0.0f}')
